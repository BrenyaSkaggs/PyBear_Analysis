# Overview 

Our goal is to find a way to improve access and affordability to ride-share services. To do this we will analyze the ride-share data we've been given
to break down the number of drivers, average cost of fare between different types of cities.


# Results

The data below is covering 01/01/2019 to 04/29/2019.

## Rural
    * 125 total number of rides
    * 78 total number of drivers
    * $4,327.93 total fares
    * $34.62 average fare per ride
    * $55.49 average fare per driver.

 ## Suburban
    * 625 total number of rides
    * 490 total number of drivers
    * $19,356.33 total fares
    * $30.97 average fare per ride
    * $39.50 average fare per driver 

## Urban 
    * 1,625 total number of rides
    * 2,405 total number of drivers
    * $39,854.38 total fares
    * $24.53 average fare per ride 
    * $16.57 average fare per driver
    
    Let's break down the fare by week. The table below provides 10 dates and the break down of weekly share by type of city.

# Summary

Looking at the data provided we can see Rural cities have almost twice the amount of total rides when are limited on the total number of drivers available.
Suburban cities also have more total rides than total drivers availble. Urban cities have 780 extra drivers that are not being used for rides. I would suggest 
expanding the ride coverage for Urban drivers to assist in the overflow over rides in Suburban and Rural cities. This could help the average fare per driver increase 
and decrease the average fare per ride in Suburban and Rural cities. Also using the fare by week data we could see when there was an increase / decrease in fares. 
This could help determine if there were specific events that caused the change in fares and if so we could look at ways in helping those cities with rides.
